    <h1>Web Projects: Spring 2018</h1>
    <p>
      In the spring of 2018 the College-Level Computer Science class at Loomis Chaffee used the <a href="http://elm-lang.org">Elm programming language</a> to create web applications.
    </p>

    <p>
      These projects were commisioned by faculty at Loomis Chaffee to serve a variety of purposes. Students worked with their clients to define and complete the project.
